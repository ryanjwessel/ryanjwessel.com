Throughout 2020, I have been reading David Allen’s book, *Getting Things Done* (also known as GTD), and gradually applying pieces of the system to my life. I just finished the book last month, so I would like to outline some of the most important lessons I have derived from the book.

Before I begin, I just want to clarify that you don’t need to read this and put every piece of it in action right away. Part of the beauty of the GTD system is that you can apply pieces of it in stages. Likely, you will be better off trying one or two things at a time first before you add onto your system. As I explain some of the fundamental parts of the system, I will call out which ones make the most sense to start implementing first.

Ultimately, the purpose of GTD is to assist you in aligning your effort with your higher-level thinking. Wouldn’t it be great if you could consistently finish the goals that you set for yourself? As you continue applying pieces of GTD, you will find yourself more effective at making progress on these bigger-picture initiatives.

## Capture: Documenting All Of Your Open Loops

An open loop is anything that has a piece of your attention at any time. Your mind is an incredible idea-generating machine, but it is not the best at remembering those ideas when they are most relevant. 

For example, you might note that you need AA batteries because your TV remote is dead. The only time you would need to remember that is when you are out running errands. However, the mind has a funny way of remembering things. That thought might pop up as soon as your head hits the pillow, but you are likely not going to make a trip to CVS when you’re about to fall asleep.
 
I have found this to be the best place to start with GTD. Early on, capture *anything* that has your attention in a centralized location. David Allen refers to this as the “In Tray,” but for more digitally-inclined people like myself, it can be called the Inbox. Apps like Todoist, TickTick, or even the iOS Reminders app, are great tools for this. Capturing all of your open loops is the first step in developing a system your mind can trust to contain all of your ideas and obligations effectively.

Once you have all of those items in your Inbox, what do you do with them? That leads us to the next stage — clarification.

## Clarify: Next Action Decision-Making

At this stage, you need to go through each item in your Inbox, define a clear, achievable outcome, and then determine what the next action is that can move you closer to that outcome.

After you have captured every open loop in your Inbox, one of those captured loops might look like this:

> - “Write an article about GTD.”

When I see this item and think about the next actions I can take to move it forward, it might look something like this:

> - “Create an outline for the GTD Overview article.”
> - “Write the first draft for the GTD Overview article.”
> - “Proofread the first draft.”
> - “Publish the article to my website.”

In this example, there are multiple actions associated with that Inbox item. Because it has more than one step, you would classify this as a **Project** (more on that in the next section). 

What I have found to be an essential part of this stage is thinking in the next action mindset. Ask yourself, “What is something that I can do to move this forward (or complete it) right now?”

Often, when you capture something in your Inbox, you are just writing it down to get it out of your head and into your system. Most of the time, your Inbox items won’t have a clear outcome with a specific action. This stage is focused exclusively on that.

Next action thinking is a skill that takes time to develop. You can start trying this today, but I still find unclear outcomes on some of my lists. Like any skill, it takes time and effort to improve.

To be honest, I often blur the lines between this stage (clarification), and the next one (organization). Usually, you would do both of them right after each other as you process each item in your Inbox. 

## Organize: Put Everything Into The Right Lists

GTD has a specific workflow for determining where an item should go based on a series of questions:

* Is this actionable?
* Will it take multiple steps to complete?
* Will it take more than 2 minutes to complete?
* Is this a task for someone else to complete?
* Is there a specific date or time associated with this action?

This step may seem daunting to go through for every item in your Inbox, but the process becomes more natural as you get used to it. I’ll do my best to step through the workflow succinctly.

Maybe you wrote down an idea like _“make an app for buffalo chicken sandwich reviews.”_ You know this is a brilliant idea, but you also know that you can’t take action on it right this second. In this case, you would put this item in the **Someday/Maybe** list. 

If the next item was a copy of the warranty for your new TV, then that isn’t something you can take action on. But, you will want that to be easily accessible if the TV has any issues. Something like this goes in your **Reference** list.

Perhaps the item is not something you find important at all. In that case, throw it in the **Trash**! 

If there are multiple actions associated with an item, then it should be made into a **Project** list.

If something takes less than two minutes to do, then you should just do it now! 

If the next action is something someone else has to do, then that item would go in the **Waiting** list. You should set reminders on these items, so you know when the appropriate time is to follow-up.

If there is a specific date or time associated with an action, then it should go in your **Calendar**. Do not assign arbitrary dates to actions! The Calendar should be a sacred space that reflects only your time-based commitments.

If an item has not satisfied any of these steps, then it should go on a generic **Next Actions** list. 

The structure of your lists might look something like this once you finish organizing:

* Inbox
* Projects
	* Write the GTD Overview Article
	* Plan trip to Rhode Island
* Next Actions
* Someday/Maybe
* Waiting
* Reference

Typically, you would maintain your Calendar in a separate system. Currently, I use Google Calendar for my date-based commitments, Bear for my Reference list, and TickTick for everything else.

Ultimately, the point of this stage is that all of the open loops in your life are easily accessible when they are relevant. So, if a slightly different organization setup makes sense for you, then go for it. 

My setup is slightly different in that I use TickTick’s tagging functionality for **Waiting**. That way, tasks can stay within their Projects, and I still have visibility for all delegated work.

Another organizational concept I have found useful is **Agendas**, which are points to remember the next time you speak with someone. I maintain a separate list for Agendas, and I apply person-specific tags to those items so I can find them easily.

In the beginning, I think these are the two most important things to remember:

* Treat your calendar as sacred. Don’t assign arbitrary dates. Your schedule should encapsulate all time-sensitive tasks.
* Ensure that you define your Projects as clearly achievable outcomes. Next-action thinking is not limited to actions!

At first, try applying the concepts of Projects to your work, and see how that goes. You can always add these other lists as a need for them arises.

## Engage: Taking Action Based On Context

David Allen defines three models for how we choose what to work on, and ensuring that our work aligns with our desired life trajectory.

### The Four Criteria Model For Decision-Making In The Moment

First, the four criteria model is used to decide what to take action on at any given moment. This model makes the most sense to implement early on in your GTD journey, and your Organizational work in the previous stage will fuel it. The four criteria for choosing what to work on are the following:

1. Context (Tools, People, Location, etc.)
2. Time
3. Energy
4. Priority

If you don’t have a computer with you, then you can’t take action on something that requires a laptop. Similarly, if you need to be in the office for something, then it can only be done if you are in the office.

If you only have twenty minutes before your next meeting, then it doesn’t make sense to pick up a task that requires more time than that. But, perhaps you could complete a few smaller tasks in that window.

There are times where you feel like you can crush any task that is on your plate. But, there are also times where you feel lethargic, and you know you would not be able to sustain long periods of concentration. In those low-energy states, attempting to barrel through a task that requires deep focus will likely result in lackluster work. Instead, you can complete some more manageable tasks for quick wins.

If you have multiple options after whittling them down based on the previous criteria, then it makes sense to gauge your decision based on what is the highest priority. Priority can be subjective, which is why it is the last criteria.

If your productivity software has a tagging or labeling system, this is where it will shine. During your clarification and organization stages, assign context, time, and energy labels to your tasks when appropriate. Then, you will be able to view all of your available work by these criteria and make the best decision for what to do at any moment.

### The Threefold Model For Evaluating Your Daily Work

Each day, your work will fall under one of these three categories:

* Doing predefined work
* Doing work that comes up in the moment
* Defining future work

Often, obligations that come up in the moment consume most of our day-to-day (aka “urgent” work). We mustn’t let the other two categories fall by the wayside because they often align with our goals and visions for our future.

The desired outcome of GTD is that you can be comfortable with deciding between these three categories. When you have a trusted system that encapsulates all of your obligations, and it’s organization allows you to assess that landscape, then you are equipped to make an informed decision that makes the best use of your time.

### The Six-level Model For Reviewing Your Vertical Alignment

Lastly, the six-level model helps you assess the alignment of your work compared to the purpose, vision, and goals in your life. David Allen refers to them as the _Horizons of Focus_, and they look something like this:

* Horizon 5: Purpose & Principles (The “Why”)
* Horizon 4: Three to five-year visions
* Horizon 3: One to two-year goals
* Horizon 2: Areas of Focus and Responsibility
* Horizon 1: Current Projects
* Ground Level: Current Actions & Calendar

Think about the work you have put effort into recently. Did some of that effort align with your vision of where you want to be in five years? If the answer to that question is not satisfactory, then you need to identify how you can transition your projects and actions to move in that direction.

Practically, it makes sense to get the current levels under control first (actions, projects, areas of focus) before actively defining your future horizons (goals, visions, and principles). Once you have those under control and you are not thinking of open loops, then your mind is free to think about the future more deeply.

To get to this point, you will need to employ the single most crucial part of the GTD system: the Review.

## Review: The Cornerstone Of GTD

The purpose of the review process is twofold — to ensure you can continue to trust in your system and to help you engage in higher-level reflection on your goals, vision, and principles. 

I have referred to “your trusted system” several times in this article. What does trust even mean in the context of productivity?

Trust is feeling comfortable with what you are doing, and what you are not doing, at any given time. It means having an awareness of everything else that you have to do, but recognizing that what you are focusing on is the best use of your time right now. This level of trust is only possible when you have a system that contains all of your current obligations, and that system is continually kept up-to-date and organized.

If you don’t discard items that are no longer relevant, or archive completed Projects, then your system will slowly transform into the equivalent of a daunting, disorganized pile of papers that are sitting on your desk. The Review process is your mechanism for keeping the system up-to-date and clear of clutter.

There are different levels of reviews that happen at varying frequencies, and I will walk through my rituals from most to least frequent.

Multiple times a day, I decide what task to take action on. I use my current context to make that decision and assess the available work on my lists. I may notice an item was already completed and mark it as done. Something may come up as an open loop, so I document it in my Inbox for future filing. All of this can be considered a micro-review.

Often, during the week, I am caught up in my day-to-day work, and cannot keep the entire system up-to-date. The single most important GTD ritual solves this problem — the Weekly Review.

Once a week, I set aside half an hour in a quiet, comfortable setting. Often, I start my Sunday with a cup of coffee, some light music, and my iPad. I have three goals for this session: get clear, get current, and get creative.

Getting clear means that each item in my Inbox has been clarified and organized appropriately and that every item reflects its current status. If something is completed, mark it as done. If something is no longer relevant, then put it in the trash. And so on.

Getting current entails reviewing the actions and events from the previous week and what is coming up in the next week. Sometimes, when I see an item a second time, it reminds me of some other action that needs to take place. If so, I capture it, clarify it, and organize it. This ensures that I am following up when necessary, and preparing appropriately for the week ahead.

Getting creative comes as a result of being clear and current. This is a fun part of the process. Ideas like “take an illustration course,” “plan a trip to a national park,” or anything else that captures your interest should be captured in your Someday/Maybe list. 

Lastly, I also have Monthly and Quarterly Reviews. During these sessions, I assess the progress I have made on my quarterly goals, and create follow-up actions to get myself back on-track if needed. At the beginning of each quarter, I reflect on the previous quarter, and set goals for the new quarter. Sometimes, I will check in on my Vision and Purpose Horizons. These sessions typically take about an hour.

What is important is that you keep your system up-to-date, and reflect on your higher horizons occassionally to ensure you are moving in the direction you want in life.

## GTD: An Integrated Life-Management System

Technology can simplify a lot of things, but it can also overwhelm us with information and connectivity. At first, I viewed GTD as a method to relieve my mind from tracking all of the information I receive on a daily basis. That is certainly one benefit, but over time it has become clear that it is so much more than that. 

I have always been one to pick up new things, or to start an ambitious goal. But, I will be the first to admit that I often lose that initial enthusiasm and don’t see these goals through to completion. Defining a vision for my future, and aligning my goals to that vision, has fueled these goals with purpose.
 
After reading this article, I hope you can see how the Getting Things Done system can help align your work with your larger aspirations. If you found this helpful, or if you have any questions, please [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/ryanjwessel) and I would love to hear from you!
