In today's session, I give a brief overview of the project I am working on, and
add some basic editing functionality to the actions on our to-do list.

This project is a goal-focused application that is guided by one key philosophy:

> - The only way to accomplish your goals is to make sure you are applying
>   consistent effort towards those goals over an extended period of time.

So, the core features of that application are:

- A To-Do List (I prefer to call it an Actions List)
- A Goal-Tracker
- The ability to link Actions to your Goals
- The ability to see if you are completing Actions that are tied to your Goals
  for a given period of time.

I will be recording my working sessions and posting them to YouTube. That way,
others can join in on this product development journey.
