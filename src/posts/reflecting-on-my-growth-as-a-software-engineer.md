I remember writing HTML and CSS to customize my MySpace profile back in 2006, an experience I'm sure many late-stage Millennials share with me. There was no end-goal. I was just tinkering with a reckless disregard for the cringe-worthiness that my middle school digital persona produced.

After that, I didn't touch anything code-related until 2010 when my high school offered a Programming elective in our computer lab. There, we learned some Flash development. I remember trying to recreate Galaga, which has always been my favorite arcade game. I designed a few sprites, and maybe got the mechanics of moving and firing the ship working.

But, it wasn't until I started to take Information Systems courses in 2014 that I realized a career in software would be a good fit for me. In fact, I loved the idea of it. Designing and building solutions for real problems at scale. Working in dynamic, fast-paced environments that would keep me mentally stimulated. It was the first time I actually had an idea of what I could be doing after I graduate college.

Reflecting on the six years since I had that realization, I can see how much I have learned over that time. However, there are many cases where I remember feeling completely overwhelmed at the sheer volume of topics that I _could_ be learning, and thinking that I am not actually good at what I do.

I am going to write about my journey into software over the past half-decade, and reflect on concepts and technologies that I familiarized myself with over that time. My hopeful outcome for those reading this is two-fold.
